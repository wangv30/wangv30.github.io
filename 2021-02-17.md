For this WOD, Invoice1 we had to create a sales receipt for 5 different products. This mean't creating a table where the contents of the table had to be calculated dynamically 
and not hard coded in. Further details about the WOD can be found here: https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html. For this WOD 
I found it to be both difficult and easy as a lot of it was pretty simple like the parts where you just had to declare and assign values to your declared variables. The parts that 
I found to be hard and that I got stumped on was the creation of the table. I didn't really know how to get started on creating a table. I ended up taking a peek at the video and 
saw that the Professor just copy pasted from the example code, and so I ended up doing that as well. Another thing that kinda stumped me for a little while in the beginning was the 
commenting part. I kept trying to do the /* ... */ and // comments but for some reason vscode just wouldn't register them as comments. I ended up figuring out my problem when I reread 
the instructions a bit more closely and found that it was because I forgot to put the comments within script tags. This was something that I forgot about until I read the phrase 
"Javascript comment" in the instructions. Other than these two problems however, the rest of the WOD was pretty easy as again it just involved declaring and assigning variables with 
expressions and operators.

I prepared for this WOD by just following along with the schedule and doing the readings when I am supposed to. Also, paying attention in class definitely helps a lot as the part where 
you have to change the hard code in the copy pasted table was similar to what we did for Lab 6. I'd say I could have prepared better for this WOD if I spent more time on the readings 
to make sure that I understood everything. I think it would also be a good idea to practice more with some of the "extra" resources that have been recommended to us.

I did this WOD pretty similarly to previous ones, where basically whenever I got stumped I would take a look at the video to see what I should be doing next. Although for this WOD 
I didn't restart the whole WOD like I would for previous ones. This is just because the part that I had to take a look at the video at was the table part and everything before that 
was stuff that I felt like I already understood really well and didn't really need to bother restarting. For the next WOD I'll probably just do the same as I have been doing which 
is to just stop when I'm stuck and get hints from the video on what I'm supposed to be doing next.
