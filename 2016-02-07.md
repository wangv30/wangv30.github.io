Browser History 1 was a bit of a challenge, but I feel like I was able to understand a lot of what I was supposed to do through the readings. By looking through and reading the
different sections of the "HTML5 Beginner Tutorial" I was able to figure out how to do some of the simpler parts of the WOD like inserting the logos into the file. There were
definitely parts of the WOD where I got stuck due to not knowing how to do certain steps to a part. So for example, inserting links to external webpages onto a word. I knew how to 
insert a link through the "a href" tag, but I would get stuck on the small step of attaching that link to the word in the paragraph. For these kinds of obstacles were where I would stop
and open up the screencast to find out how exactly I was supposed to do the step. I definitely feel like this method of learning is useful and works as it involves me trying it out on
my own first, seeing the solution when I have trouble, and then trying it out again from scratch. This WOD was pretty frustrating, but I feel like I learned a lot and am more familiar
with the usage of HTML.

Browser History 2 was a lot easier than Browser History 1. With this one, I just had to go back to the CSS tutorial to find some of the code needed to style my file. This WOD was
pretty simple as you kind of just needed an understanding of CSS and how to link the CSS file to your HTML file. I think the one thing that I had a little trouble with was getting the
font to work. I made the mistake of quickly skimming through the googlefonts guide and missed the part where it said you had to insert a href tag to the google font file containing
the "Oswald" and Open Sans" fonts. After referring to the screencast though, I realized my mistake and was able to finish the WOD without too much problem.

Browser History 3 had me stumped a bit. I didn't really know where to start for a lot of the steps like making the different sections and formatting the table of contents. Seeing
as how I was kind of confused on how to do a lot of the stuff, I decided to do a different method of learning. I decided to watch the entire screencast and follow along with it while
trying to understand the reasoning behind each step. Then I deleted the files and did it on my own after waiting a while so as not to just do everything by memory, with this I was able to 
do it on my own without much problem.
