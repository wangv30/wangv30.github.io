Browser History 1 was a bit of a challenge, but I feel like I was able to understand a lot of what I was supposed to do through the readings. By looking through and reading the
different sections of the "HTML5 Beginner Tutorial" I was able to figure out how to do some of the simpler parts of the WOD like inserting the logos into the file. There were
definitely parts of the WOD where I got stuck due to not knowing how to do certain steps to a part. So for example, inserting links to external webpages onto a word. I knew how to 
insert a link through the "a href" tag, but I would get stuck on the small step of attaching that link to the word in the paragraph. For these kinds of obstacles were where I would stop
and open up the screencast to find out how exactly I was supposed to do the step. I definitely feel like this method of learning is useful and works as it involves me trying it out on
my own first, seeing the solution when I have trouble, and then trying it out again from scratch. This WOD was pretty fustrating, but I feel like I learned a lot and am more familiar
with the usage of HTML.

Browser History 2 was a lot easier than Browser History 1.
